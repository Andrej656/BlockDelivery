## Smart Contracts

The smart contracts are responsible for the core functionality of the marketplace, including:
1. **Listing Products**: Sellers can list their products for sale with a name, description, and price (in ETH).
2. **Tracking Sales**: Buyers can purchase products, and the smart contract will transfer funds and update product statuses.

The smart contract is written in **Solidity** and deployed on the Ethereum test network (such as Rinkeby or Binance Smart Chain Testnet).

## Frontend (React.js)

The frontend is built using **React.js** and interacts with the deployed smart contract via **Ethers.js**. It provides the following components:
- **Wallet Connection**: Using **Web3Modal**, users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Product Listing Form**: Allows users to add new product listings to the marketplace.
- **Product Display**: Displays all products available for sale, with real-time data fetched from the smart contract.
